Introduction to File I/O in C âœ… 
  In C programming, working with files is an essential skill. File Input/Output (I/O) allows a program to read data from or write data to files, making programs more versatile by enabling data storage and retrieval. C provides a set of standard library functions to manage files, making it possible to perform various operations like reading, writing, and modifying file contents.

In this chapter, we will explore:
  File Handling Basics: Understanding how to open and close files using fopen() and fclose(), and the various modes (read, write, append) to handle files effectively.
  Reading and Writing Data: Using functions like fscanf(), fprintf(), fgetc(), and fputc() to read and write data in different formats.
  Error Handling: Checking if a file exists or if an error occurs during file operations. This is crucial for avoiding crashes and ensuring that data operations are successful.
  End of File (EOF): Understanding how to handle the end of a file when reading data, ensuring that you don't try to read beyond the available content.
  Practical Applications: Programs that demonstrate file handling, including reading integers, writing strings, handling student records, and more.

This chapter will not only help you get familiar with file handling techniques but also enable you to develop robust programs capable of processing and storing data efficiently.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to use file I/O in C for a variety of real-world applications.
