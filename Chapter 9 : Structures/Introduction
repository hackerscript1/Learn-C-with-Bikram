Introduction to Structures in C ✅ 
  In C programming, structures allow you to group variables of different data types under a single name. A structure is a user-defined data type that can hold multiple pieces of data, such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, in a single entity. This is especially useful when you need to manage related data together, such as student details, employee records, or complex numbers.

  Structures help in organizing data and make the code more readable and maintainable. Each member of a structure is referred to as a field or member, and you can access them using the dot operator (.) or the arrow operator (->) when dealing with pointers.

This chapter covers:
  Declaring and initializing structures
  Using arrays of structures
  Passing structures to functions
  Using pointers with structures
  Understanding the typedef keyword to create structure aliases

By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to work with structures, which are fundamental for efficient data management in C programming.
